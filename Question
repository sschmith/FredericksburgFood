Hi Steve,
    What username and password do the login screen accept? It doesn't do anything if I click the button. No error, but it doesn't
take me anywhere. Just trying to see how navigating the site feels.

Lauren, 
The usernames/passwords I created are:
admin/password
Shaq/bball

But they probably won't work on your compute. The PHP code is trying to connect to a database
on your computer that doesn't exist (I made a simple database on my computer so I could work on the site),
so it's breaking the webpage. I'm going to try to fix it before class.
